<pre> 
It's You 

Since the start you dragged me out of darkness

You were the casue for some much growth in spite of hard head

The Lord has been leading me to a better place with Himself 

And you have been the greatest catalyst for that.

May the Lord grow my stregth.

By his power I will overcome my flesh, 

And through that, may I honor you with the consistency of commitment.

Though my thoughts are tossed like waves, you keep me steady.

And I wish to grow and steady myself that I may be a safe stronghold for you.

If there is one person I wish to choose everyday

over and over again.

It's you.
